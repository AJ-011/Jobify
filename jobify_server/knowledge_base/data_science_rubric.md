Data Scientist / Analyst Evaluation Rubric
Guiding Principle
A strong data science resume must prove the candidate's ability to translate data into measurable business value. It requires a clear demonstration of the entire data lifecycle: from cleaning and exploration to modeling and communicating insights.

Tier 1: Non-Negotiable Requirements
1. Quantified, Cause-and-Effect Impact:

FAIL: "Analyzed a dataset." or "Built a machine learning model."

PASS: Bullet points connect a specific analytical method to a concrete business outcome.

Example: "Developed a logistic regression model to predict customer churn with 85% accuracy, which allowed the marketing team to target at-risk customers and reduce churn by 15%."

2. Statistical & Modeling Depth:

FAIL: Vaguely mentions "machine learning" or "statistics."

PASS: Names the specific models or statistical tests used and explains why they were chosen for the problem.

Example: "Utilized a Random Forest model over a simple linear regression due to its ability to capture non-linear relationships in the feature set, resulting in a 10% improvement in predictive accuracy."

Tier 2: Strong Indicators
3. Data Wrangling & Feature Engineering:

FAIL: Assumes data is clean and ready for modeling.

PASS: Explicitly describes the process of cleaning messy data (e.g., handling missing values, outliers) and creating new features to improve model performance.

4. Communication & Visualization:

FAIL: The project ends with a model's accuracy score.

PASS: The candidate discusses communicating findings to stakeholders (e.g., business users, product managers) using tools like Tableau, Matplotlib, or detailed reports.

5. Technical Toolkit:

FAIL: A generic list of tools.

PASS: Shows mastery of the core data science stack (Python with Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn; or R) and experience with SQL for data extraction.

Tier 3: Red Flags
Lack of Business Context: The analysis is technically sound but has no clear connection to solving a real-world problem.

Over-reliance on a single tool/model: Shows a lack of versatility and understanding of when to use different techniques.

"Black Box" Explanations: The candidate can't explain the "why" behind their modeling choices.
