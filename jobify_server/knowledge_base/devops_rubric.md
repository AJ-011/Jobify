DevOps / SRE Evaluation Rubric
Guiding Principle
A top-tier DevOps/SRE resume proves the candidate's ability to build and maintain scalable, reliable, and automated infrastructure. It must demonstrate a deep understanding of the full software lifecycle, from code commit to production monitoring, with a focus on efficiency and stability.

Tier 1: Non-Negotiable Requirements
1. Quantified, Cause-and-Effect Impact:

FAIL: "Managed AWS servers." or "Set up a CI/CD pipeline."

PASS: Bullet points connect a specific action to a measurable improvement in reliability, speed, or cost.

Example: "Automated the deployment process using GitHub Actions, which reduced manual deployment time from 2 hours to 10 minutes and eliminated human error."

2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in Practice:

FAIL: Vaguely mentions "cloud" or "automation."

PASS: Names specific IaC tools (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible) and explains what was provisioned with them.

Example: "Wrote Terraform modules to provision a repeatable VPC network architecture on AWS, ensuring consistent environments from development to production."

Tier 2: Strong Indicators
3. Cloud Proficiency (AWS/GCP/Azure):

FAIL: A generic mention of a cloud provider.

PASS: Lists specific services used (e.g., EC2, S3, RDS, IAM on AWS) and explains their role in the overall architecture.

4. Containerization & Orchestration:

FAIL: Just lists "Docker."

PASS: Demonstrates experience creating Dockerfiles to containerize applications and, ideally, managing them with an orchestrator like Kubernetes (EKS, GKE) or a simpler service (ECS, Cloud Run).

5. Monitoring & Observability:

FAIL: No mention of what happens after deployment.

PASS: Shows experience with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog), setting up alerts, and analyzing logs to diagnose production issues.

Tier 3: Red Flags
Manual Mindset: Describes processes that sound manual and time-consuming (e.g., "Manually deployed code via FTP").

Lack of Security Awareness: No mention of security best practices, IAM roles, or managing secrets.

Developer Focus: The resume focuses heavily on application feature development rather than the underlying infrastructure and processes.
