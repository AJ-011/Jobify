Backend Engineer Evaluation Rubric
Guiding Principle
A top-tier backend resume proves skill through evidence of building scalable, efficient, and reliable systems. It must demonstrate not just what was built, but why specific architectural decisions were made and what their impact was.

Tier 1: Non-Negotiable Requirements
1. Quantified, Cause-and-Effect Impact:

FAIL: "Built a REST API." or "Increased efficiency by 20%."

PASS: Bullet points demonstrate a clear cause-and-effect relationship and are quantified.

Example: "Reduced API response time by 40% by implementing a Redis caching layer for frequently accessed data, which minimized database queries under heavy load."

2. Technical Depth in Context:

FAIL: A generic list of databases and languages.

PASS: Technologies are tied to specific architectural functions.

Example: "Architected a PostgreSQL database with optimized indexing to handle 1 million+ user records and ensure data integrity."

Tier 2: Strong Indicators
3. System Design & Scalability:

FAIL: Projects are simple CRUD applications with no thought for scale.

PASS: The candidate discusses architectural patterns (e.g., microservices, event-driven), scalability solutions (e.g., load balancing, message queues), or database choices that reflect an understanding of building for growth.

4. API Design & Security:

FAIL: Only mentions creating "APIs."

PASS: Demonstrates knowledge of RESTful principles, API versioning, and security best practices like authentication/authorization (e.g., JWT, OAuth 2.0).

5. Modern Development Practices:

FAIL: No mention of version control, testing, or infrastructure.

PASS: Explicitly mentions Git, robust testing (unit, integration, load testing), and experience with cloud deployment and containerization (e.g., Docker, AWS, GCP).

Tier 3: Red Flags
Ignoring Data: No mention of database design, query optimization, or data modeling.

Frontend Focus: The majority of project work is on the UI, indicating a weaker fit for a dedicated backend role.

Generic Statements: Typos, poor formatting, and non-tailored summaries.
