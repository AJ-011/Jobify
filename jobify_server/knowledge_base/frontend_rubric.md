Frontend Engineer Evaluation Rubric
Guiding Principle
An exceptional frontend resume demonstrates a deep understanding of user interface architecture, performance, and the creation of intuitive, responsive experiences. It must prove skill through well-designed components and measurable improvements to the user-facing product.

Tier 1: Non-Negotiable Requirements
1. Quantified, Cause-and-Effect Impact:

FAIL: "Built a web app with React." or "Made the website faster."

PASS: Bullet points show a clear cause-and-effect relationship focused on the user experience.

Example: "Improved initial page load time by 30% by implementing code-splitting and lazy loading for non-critical components, which enhanced the user experience on slower connections."

2. Component Architecture & State Management:

FAIL: Lists "React" or "Vue" as a skill.

PASS: Describes how they used the framework to build a scalable and maintainable UI.

Example: "Developed a library of 30+ reusable React components with Storybook to ensure design consistency and accelerate development speed across the team." or "Managed complex application state using Redux Toolkit, which eliminated prop-drilling and simplified data flow."

Tier 2: Strong Indicators
3. UI/UX & Design Sensibility:

FAIL: Projects are functional but visually unappealing or difficult to use.

PASS: The candidate discusses working from design mockups (e.g., Figma), building responsive layouts for multiple devices, and considering accessibility (a11y) standards.

4. Performance Optimization:

FAIL: No mention of performance.

PASS: Demonstrates knowledge of frontend performance concepts like bundle size analysis, network request optimization, and rendering performance (e.g., memoization).

5. API Consumption & Integration:

FAIL: Projects use only local or mock data.

PASS: Shows experience fetching, displaying, and managing data from real-world REST or GraphQL APIs, including handling loading and error states.

Tier 3: Red Flags
No Live Demos: No links to live, deployed projects. A frontend developer must show their work.

Backend-Heavy Projects: The bulk of the complexity is on the server-side, indicating a weaker fit for a dedicated frontend role.

Outdated Technologies: Reliance on older tools (e.g., jQuery, class-based React components) without showing knowledge of modern practices.
